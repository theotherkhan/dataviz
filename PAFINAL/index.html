    <h6> Attack Description: </h6>

    <h2>(hover over an attack to find out more)</h2>

    <p id="text"> Over the past couple of years, Europe has faced a surge in refugee migration unlike any seen since the end of the second World War.
      Such a large demographic shift brings about important questions regarding the impact of refugees on a nation's economy, demography, and security. More
      specifically, there has been intense debate on whether refugees cause violence and terrorism in their host countries — an idea that
      European far-right parties consistently emphasize and integrate into platform. Germany, being the leading European acceptor of refugees,
      stands as the nation most involved with these issues. In this visualization, one can explore a narrower slice of the overall
      discussion: how, if at all, does the influx of refugees relate to terrorist incidents in a country? By interacting with the time slider,
      the user can begin to understand the temporal and demographic scale of the migrant crisis in Germany, as well as how it has (or has not) subsequently
      effected terrorism incidents in Germany. <br> <br>

      A large influx of migrants starts to kick in towards the end of 2015, when there is a spike in refugee applications to Germany, coming
      primarily from the Arab world. Notice the demographics of the incoming migrants: a majority are young men between the ages of 18 and 35, which is
      the primary group known to commit crime and terrorism, irrespective of origin or ethnicity. The biggest terror attacks are
      clustered toward the end of 2016. <br> <br>

      Using the filters under the time slider, the user can also view terrorist attacks specifically involving refugees, either as perpetrators or as targets.
      Doing so shows that only two terrorist attacks were carried out by refugees, despit the oft-made claim that Germany's open door policies allow for Foreign
      terror groups to exploit lax border laws and sneak members into European countries.
